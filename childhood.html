    <h1>Childhood</h1>
    <p>
       I was born and raised in Naivasha, a beautiful town in the Rift Valley surrounded by Lake Naivasha, flower farms, and wildlife. 
       Life there was peaceful yet grounded mornings spent helping around the home, playing near the lake, and watching the geothermal activity at Hell's Gate inspire a sense of wonder about energy and systems.
        School was a mix of curiosity and challenge; 
        I remember being fascinated by the first computers in our local cyber cafe, where I'd sneak in to play simple games or browse the internet.
        Those early moments of typing commands and seeing things happen on screen sparked something in me—tech felt like a way to solve real problems, even in a place known more for agriculture than innovation. 
        </p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
        My passion for becoming a techie—and specifically pursuing software engineering—truly ignited around 2012, when I was young but old enough to absorb big ideas from TV, family discussions, and news. 
        I vividly recall watching interviews and coverage about Bob Collymore, the then-CEO of Safaricom. He passionately explained how M-Pesa was revolutionizing Kenya by empowering millions—especially in rural areas like Naivasha—through instant mobile money transfers without needing traditional banks.
         His vision highlighted how technology wasn't just gadgets; it was a tool for social and economic transformation, putting power in people's hands and driving innovation from the ground up. Hearing him speak about Kenya as the heart of Africa's mobile revolution, and how continuous innovation in platforms like M-Pesa could change lives, motivated me deeply. 
         It showed me that software engineering could solve local problems on a massive scale, inspiring me to dream of building apps and systems that make life easier for Kenyans everywhere.
        That local spark was amplified by global tech giants like Microsoft and Google, whose stories reached me through online videos, articles, and school resources. 
        Microsoft's investments in Africa—building development centers in Nairobi, focusing on AI, cloud computing, and skilling programs—demonstrated a commitment to nurturing talent right here in Kenya. 
        I was drawn to how their engineers create tools that scale globally while addressing real-world challenges. Similarly, Google's emphasis on innovation, from search algorithms to AI advancements, and their support for African startups and education initiatives, showed me the endless possibilities in software engineering. 
        These companies proved that with strong problem-solving skills, creativity, and persistence, someone from a middle-class Nairobi home or a Naivasha background could contribute to world-changing tech. They motivated me to dive deeper into coding, algorithms, and software design principles.

    <h3>Current pursuits</h3>
    <p>
        Today, at Kirinyaga University, I’m deeply engaged in software engineering coursework—studying data structures, algorithms, software development methodologies, web and mobile app development, databases, and emerging technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
        Beyond the classroom, I’ve actively pursued hands-on learning and professional certifications to strengthen my skills:
      <ul>
        <li>
            I’ve completed A.I. and Machine Learning classes through the Computer Society of Kirinyaga University club, where I worked on practical projects and collaborated with peers passionate about intelligent systems.
        </li>
        <ul>I’m currently working toward several industry-recognized online certifications:
            <li>Oracle Vector Search Professional certification</li>
            <li>Oracle certification in  Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Cisco certificattion in Data analysis</li>
            <li>Data Engineering Zoomcamp — a comprehensive, hands-on program focused on modern data engineering practices, pipelines, and tools</li>
            <li>MERN Stack online scholarship course under the Power Plan Foundation, which I’m completing to gain full-stack web development expertise using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

These experiences have shown me that software engineering is about more than writing code—it’s about designing reliable, scalable, secure, and user-centered solutions that solve real problems.
Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to Kenya’s tech ecosystem by developing fintech tools, agritech platforms, AI-powered applications, or secure cloud-based systems—building on M-Pesa’s legacy while applying global best practices from leaders like Microsoft, Google, and the broader open-source community. My journey from Naivasha’s lakeside to Nairobi’s hustle, and now to university, has taught me resilience, curiosity, and the immense power of technology to uplift communities.
